						 <h2>Aries</h2>
						 <img class="img" src="" alt="">
						<data>Birthday: March 21–April 20</data>
						<p>Your personality: You're a bold, adventurous competitor, and we wish lots of luck to anyone who tries to take you on. "You're an expert at being first," says Star. "The more you compete, the more driven your spirit will be to commit to routines."</p>
						<p>Try: Metric-based cycling, like Flywheel Sports or Equinox's Pursuit</p>
						<p>Metric-based cycling allows you to monitor your progress and engage in a little friendly competition, whether that's through numbers only—like at Flywheel—or through video game–like competitions throughout class, which you'll find in Pursuit. "At Flywheel, every studio is equipped with TorqBoards—large flat screens at the front of the room that show class leaders and performance data," says Ruth Zukerman, creative director and co-founder of Flywheel Sports. "The boards flash real-time data throughout class for those who want to see how they rank against others." But don't freak if you're having an off day—adding your name to the board in either studio is completely optional.</p>
					</article>
				
					<article class="page">
						 <h2>Taurus</h2>
						 <img class="img" src="" alt="">
						<data>Birthday: April 21–May 21</data>
						<p>Your personality: Known for being a chill, calm stabilizer, the grounded Taurus exercises patience more than any other sign. "Wherever workouts take you, doing them in nature makes your soul sing," says Star. "When you know you are grounded, the rewards are yours for the taking."</p>
						<p>Try: Outdoor boot camp, like <a href="http://www.stacysbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Stacy's Bootcamp</a> or <a href="http://november-project.com/" target="_blank">November Project</a></p>
						<p>Clocking a hardcore workout of burpees, push-ups, and planks while still connecting with the earth is the perfect balance for the persistent, yet patient, Taurus. Many of these workouts have you rising with the sun, too, giving your day a rejuvenating start. "For the powerful bull, this combination is a perfect fit...at one moment it's peacefully grazing the land [translation: gentle warm-ups], at the next it's charging full force [hello, burpees!]," says Stacy Berman, founder of Stacy's Bootcamp. "Opt for a program that offers all outdoor classes—all year long, rain or shine—so your commune with nature is complete."</p>

						 <h2>Gemini</h2>
						 <img class="img" src="" alt="">
						<data>Birthday: May 22–June 20</data>
						<p>Your personality: Find yourself in your own head a lot? That's because the Gemini is known for being an intellectually alert thinker. To avoid boredom and ensure you stay focused, Star suggests you always "breathe deep throughout your workouts and make sure your mind is equally involved," utilizing your inventive hands whenever possible.</p>
						<p>Try: Pilates:</p>
						<p>Pilates classes equal prime time for focusing on your breathing, and the regular flow of movement keeps your mind engaged—leaving little room for it to wander. "There aren't many exercise methods that build strength and flexibility at the same time," says Téana David, a Pilates coordinator at <a href="http://www.davidbartongym.com/" target="_blank">David Barton Gym.</a> "Get the best of both worlds with our Pilates Mat Classes. You'll find the twin styles of classical and contemporary Pilates (think more creative takes on standard Pilates moves, with some dance influence) under one roof, which means double trouble for your abs!"</p>

						 <h2>Cancer</h2>
						 <img class="img" src="" alt="">
						<data>Birthday: June 21–July 22</data>
						<p>Your personality: You're a sensitive, emotional nurturer who loves spending time with family, especially if it's in the kitchen. To burn off that indulgent meal, head to the water—or at least a class that simulates it. "You feel most nurtured and alive when near the water [as do other water signs] and like to be involved in fitness routines that allow you to reflect," says Star. "You, too, can intuitively lead the team to win," so head to the front of the class for your next sweat session.</p>
						<p>Try: Variations of <a href="http://crunchfitness.ie/hatha-yoga?gclid=COTSr7TtwsICFYVf2wodx3gAtA" target="_blank">yoga</a>, like <a href="https://www.crunch.com/splash/" target="_blank">Crunch's H2-OM</a> or <a href="http://www.surfsetfitness.com/tools/class-locator/"target="_blank">SURFSET Fitness.</a></p>
						<p>If you're looking for a workout that focuses on the inside along with the outside, yoga is your match. "It's an all-inclusive body workout that has a continuous flow of energy and allows you to get in touch with your full body (and soul, if you're fully engaged)," says Marc Santa Maria, national director of group fitness at Crunch. Rooted in yoga, Crunch's H2-OM class is an interval workout that allows you to find your sea legs on the mat, then apply them on a surfboard as the sound of crashing waves plays in the background. Music to a crab's ears.</p>

						 <h2>Lion</h2>
						 <img class="img" src="" alt="">
						<data>Birthday: July 23–August 22</data>
						<p>Your personality: Typically the life of the party, the Leo is known for being a creatively expressive entertainer. "If your heart's into a routine, you'll keep coming back for more, especially if you have an audience," says Star. Cue the stage lights!</p>
						<p>Try: Dance classes or <a href="http://www.zumba.com/en-US" target="_blank">Zumba</p>
						<p>If you like to put on a show, try a dancing studio where every workout will feel like a performance, suggests Stephen Brotebeck, artistic director of <a href="http://broadwaybodies.com/" target="_blank"> Broadway Bodies</a>. "Incorporating choreographed dance movements, whether basic or challenging, with high-impact aerobics gives you a fun and exciting cardio class that encourages you to sing along while you sweat." If Top 40 tunes are more your style, give Zumba a try, where instructors lead you through routines to the latest radio hits with extra Latin flair (think basic salsa and merengue steps) to honor the program's roots.</p>

					<article class="page">
						 <h2>Virgo</h2>
						 <img class="img" src="" alt="">
						<data>Birthday: August 23–September 22</data>
						<p>Your personality: Known to be the efficient, methodical purist of the sun signs, it's not unusual for you to find yourself tidying up or trying to fix what's wrong. "Whatever exercise routine takes your mind away from fixing the details makes your doubt go away too," says Star.</p>
						<p>Try: Core exercises</p>
						<p>Santa Maria points out that one of the main benefits of core work is its ability to put you in touch with your gut and instinct. With Crunch's The Hang-Over class, "aerial silks suspend you in the air, forcing you to work against gravity to lift yourself up and give your lower abs a major fat-blast." Another chisel-happy option? TRX classes, which turn up the toning power by working on an unstable surface.</p>
					</article>	

					<article class="page">
						 <h2>Libra</h2>
						 <img class="img" src="" alt="">
						<data>Birthday: September 23–October 22</data>
						<p>Your personality: Not usually one to start a fight (or make a mess of things), the Libra is a friendly, peaceful cooperator whose interests including finding balance and making things pretty. "Focusing on balance and grace to stay fit channels those tendencies," says Star, who also notes your leadership skills would make you the perfect referee.</p>
						<p>Try: Barre</p>
						<p>"With barre, the focus is on isolating muscles and firing them up through small, isometric, low-impact movements," says Katelyn DiGiorgio, director of training at <a href="http://purebarre.com/" target="_blank">Pure Barre Corporate</a>. "You'll benefit from strength training sections that focus on women's trouble zones: hips, thighs, butt, abs, and arms, followed by stretch sections that help lengthen your muscles." Once you have the hang of things, we wouldn't be surprised if you start seeking out instructor training. Go, girl.</p>

						 <h2>Scorpio</h2>
						 <img class="img" src="" alt="">
						<data>Birthday: October 23–November 21</data>
						<p>Your personality: Intense much? Known to be fearless investigators (ahem, with a very high sex drive), the Scorpio is passionate about all things in life—and exercise is no exception. "Empowering workouts that help you feel invigorated ignite your passion to work out," says Star. "Choose intense routines, whether on land or water, that strengthen your core from the root chakra, the center of your spiritual power."</p>
						<p>Try: Water workouts, like <a href="http://www.equinox.com/groupfitness" target="_blank"> Equinox's Aqua Bootcamp</a> or <a harf="http://www.rjvalentinsdeepwaterrunning.com/" target="_blank">RJ Valentin's Deep Water Running</a></p>
						<p>It's all about the adrenaline rush for you, and working—or running—it out reminds you that you're in charge. When swimming laps or pounding pavement solo doesn't do the trick, try an aqua bootcamp like those offered at Equinox. "It challenges the body by using the resistance of the water on all your major muscle groups, and timed intervals crank up the intensity of each exercise."</p>

					<article class="page">
						 <h2>Sagittarius</h2>
						 <img class="img" src="" alt="">
						<data>Birthday: November 22–December 21</data>
						<p>Your personality: Sagittarians are known as the best athletes among all the signs. (Go ahead, dust your shoulder off. We'll wait!) Star says, "You are the ultimate multitasker and athlete that possesses amazing stamina. But only if you are connected to your body, mind, and spirit."</p>
						<p>Try: Fusion classes, like <a href="http://www.circuitofchange.com/" target="_blank">Circuit of Change</a> or <a href="http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/piyo-workout.do" target="_blank">PiYo</a></p>
						<p>"Fitness classes that combine tons of different techniques will burn a massive amount of calories while reducing stress and helping you find balance," says Brian Delmonico, founder of Circuit of Change. "[At our studio], we combine yoga, martial arts, core fusion, gymnastics, and meditation into a high-intensity cardio and strength workout, pushing your physical and mental limits, so you never get bored or plateau."</p>
					</article>
 
					<article class="page">
						 <h2>Capricorn</h2>
						 <img class="img" src="" alt="">
						<data>Birthday: December 22–January 19</data>
						<p>Your personality: Always the disciplined, dependable strategist, you commit to things for the long haul, so workouts that require endurance, patience, and precision are best. "You always enjoy the routine that gives you a sense of achievement," says Star. We're gonna go ahead and guess there's a race medal rack with your name on it. If there's not, then we know what your next birthday gift should be.</p>
						<p>Try: Challenging classes, like <a href="http://www.sltnyc.com/" target="_blank">SLT</a>, or races, like  <a href="https://toughmudder.com/" target="_blank">Tough Mudder</a></p>
						<p>"To build up your body's endurance, slowing down your workout may be the way to go," says Amanda Freeman, CEO and Founder of SLT. "Forcing your muscles to work at a slower pace [whether that's at a 4-count pace in an SLT class or when sludging through heavy mud and water on an obstacle course] will activate your slow-twitch muscle fibers, thus leading to long, lean results. It enables you to be more precise with movements and is more likely to avoid injury."</p>

					<article class="page">
						 <h2>Aquarius</h2>
						 <img class="img" src="" alt="">
						<data>Birthday: January 20–February 18</data>
						<p>Your personality: Not to be mistaken for a follower, you're great at maintaining a sense of individuality while surrounded by a group. For a bond-boosting Aquarius like yourself, the most enjoyable workouts integrate teamwork, "especially if it involves friends and a cause for humanity," says Star. "Your blood loves to flow, so set the pace high and dare your buddies to keep up."</p>
						<p>Try: Team fitness classes, like <a href="http://www.swervefitness.com/" target="_blank">SWERVE</a> or <a href="http://throwbackfit.com/" target="_blank">Throwback Fitness</a></p>
						<p>"Competing as a team pushes people to work harder than they might otherwise have if they were working out alone. The team holds you accountable to work your hardest, but is also there to cheer you on and support you every step of the way," says Dyan Tsiumis, head instructor at SWERVE. "The high-intensity intervals that each of our classes is composed of, coupled with the team spirit and fierce music, will get Aquarian hearts racing!" Set up a charity ride for your next fundraiser to get the biggest heartwarming bang for your buck.</p>

						 <h2>Pisces</h2>
						 <img class="img" src="" alt="">
						<data>Birthday: February 19–March 20</data>
						<p>Your personality: The good news? Your empathetic nature makes you the best friend everyone wants to sweat out a bad day with. The bad news? Your tendency to really feel things can get the best of you. To stay focused (and calm any anxiety), Star suggests meditating and getting your feet wet. "Being a water sign, you're a fish out of water if you work out on land too much, so make sure you are swimming more often than not," she says.</p>
						<p>Try: Aquacycling</p>
						<p>"Aquacycling is a unique detox workout. It offers you a natural detoxifying massage while you pedal and stimulates your entire lymphatic system [responsible for defending the body against disease among other things]," says Esther Gauthier, founder of AQUA Studio NY. When you're stuck on land, try this beginner's guide on how to meditate to hold you over.</p>
