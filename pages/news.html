						<h2>THE 7 BEST FAT-BLASTERS</h2>
						<div>
							<p>We all have days when there's no time to get to the gym. So we wondered: Which close-to-home cardio activities blast fat fastest? Wonder no more. Here are the top seven fat-and-calorie burners, from Los Angeles–based celeb trainer Ramona Braganza, who has helped shape the amazing bodies of stars like Jessica Alba, Halle Berry, and Anne Hathaway. Try any one of these, and you'll boost your metabolism for up to a whole day afterward. One small workout, one giant payoff.</p>
							
							<h3>1. Inline Skating</h3>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Burns 425 calories in 30 minutes</span></p>
							<p>Skating is numero uno on our list when it comes to blasting fat and calories. The big burn stems from the side-to-side movement of your thigh and butt muscles. And your core gets involved in a big way to keep you balanced. What's more, you get all these benefits without putting too much stress on your knees and other joints. Skate at a strong, steady pace. (Don’t forget your helmet, wrist guards, and knee and elbow pads.)</p>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Boost the burn:</span> Alternate one minute of hard skating with one minute of medium-paced strokes.</p>
							
							<h3>2. Running</h3>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Burns 374 calories in 30 minutes</span></p>
							<p>The typical runner's shape is sleek and lean, and there's a reason for that: The major running muscles—legs, butt, core—happen to be the biggest calorie-and-fat-burning muscles in your body. To get the most out of each stride, swing your arms close to your body, don't lean forward, and keep your feet low to the ground. To lessen impact, land on the middle of your foot, then roll through to your toes.</p>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Boost the burn:</span> Alternate fast and slow intervals, or take to the hills.</p>
							
							<h3>3. Jumping Rope</h3>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Burns 340 calories in 30 minutes</span></p>
							<p>You knew this workout had to be high on the list. After all, it’s one of pro boxers' favorite ways to train. To get the most from each jump, use a rope with handles that reach to just under your armpits when you stand on the middle of it, and follow these top-form tips: Jump with your feet slightly apart and body upright, and keep your jumps low to the ground. Don’t have a rope? You’ll get the same benefits by doing the movements rope-free.</p>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Boost the burn:</span> Frequently switch up your speed (slow, fast) and style (jumping with one foot, then two feet), or jump rope while you jog.</p>
							
							<h3>4. Hula Hooping</h3>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Burns 300 calories in 30 minutes</span></p>
							<p>Marisa Tomei and Beyoncé hoop to keep their bodies beautiful. To do it yourself, grab an adult-sized hoop (they're larger and heavier than kids' hoops, making them easier to spin); you'll know you have the right size if it reaches your chest when you stand it up in front of you. Simply keep it going around your waist. To start, stand with one foot in front of the other and shift your weight back and forth (versus around in a circle). And don't worry if you're less than perfect at first; you'll still knock off major calories, plus get better every time you spin.</p>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Boost the burn:</span> Try the hula-hoop spinnning for as long as you can!</p>
							
							<h3>5. Tennis</h3>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Burns 272 calories in 30 minutes</span></p>
							<p>Don't think you need to round up a partner or trek all the way to a court to break a super sweat with racket in hand. Simply find a flat area near a wall or garage door that you can hit the ball against. Alternate forehand and backhand shots—then see how many you can do in a row without goofing. Stand 10 to 25 feet away, which will force you to hit harder. Even practicing your serve will get your body in burn mode, because you’ll have to run and bend to pick up your missed balls.</p>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Boost the burn:</span> Try to hit the ball consistently for 50 or 100 strokes. "Having a goal will make you work harder to reach it," Braganza says.</p>
							
							<h3>6. Dancing</h3>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Burns 221 calories in 30 minutes</span></p>
							<p>This may not be the biggest calorie-burner in the bunch, but it's still an excellent—and fun!—metabolism booster. (Just look at Kelly Osbourne, who jump-started her amazing 42-pound loss on Dancing with the Stars.) The key is to keep the tempo high, choosing songs with fast rhythms like Latin or Bollywood, and don't rest between songs. Try Braganza's favorite trick: Download a workout's worth of your favorite tunes. Begin with an upbeat inspirational song (think "Just Dance" by Lady Gaga), then move on to songs with increasingly faster tempos. Slow the beat toward the end to cool down.</p>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Boost the burn:</span> Use your arms! Raise them in the air and move them to the beat.</p>
							
							<h3>7. Walking vigorously</h3>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Burns 170 calories in 30 minutes</span></p>
							<p>That's right, walking actually made our list. Full disclosure, though: A leisurely stroll with a friend won’t cut it. You should be walking briskly enough that it's difficult to keep up a steady conversation. To get the most from your biggest calorie-burning muscles—legs, butt, and core—take short, quick steps, keep your torso upright, and pump your arms back and forth (not side to side) in time with your stride. With each step, land on your heel and roll through to your toes.</p>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Boost the burn:</span> Alternate two minutes of brisk strides with one minute of as-fast-as-you-can-go walking (or jogging).</p>

						<h2>5 TIPS FOR BUILDING MENTAL STAMINA</h2>
						<div>
							<p>Watching the Olympics, we're all awed by the athletes' bodies -- the perfect physiques of gods and goddesses. But one of their greatest assets is something you can't see -- their mental stamina. "Athletes can get far on raw physical ability," says Robert E. Corb, PhD, a psychologist and director of the Sports Psychology Program at UCLA. "But what separates the truly elite from the rest is that they know how to use their minds." You can build up mental stamina with training, just like physical strength, experts say. It also has many uses. "Mental stamina skills aren't only for athletes," Corb says. They can help musicians, actors, writers, or anyone who needs to perform, he tells WebMD. How can you build up your mental stamina before your next race -- or presentation at work? Here are tips for Olympic athletes and office workers alike.</p>
							<h3>1. Think Positively</h3>
							<p>"Self-confidence is probably the most important mental characteristic that athletes need," says Corb. Self-confidence doesn't just stem from physical ability. We've all seen highly-skilled athletes who lose their self-confidence and fall apart. How do you get more self-confidence? Corb urges people to listen to what they're saying to themselves -- maybe not even consciously. "If you keep saying, 'I'll never be able to do this,' before a marathon, then you won't be able to do it," says Corb. "If you say something enough to yourself, you'll make it true." Corb stresses that building self-confidence is a mental exercise that you can practice. Listen to what you're saying about yourself. If what you hear is negative, correct it. Consciously think more positive thoughts. In time, interrupting negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones will have a real effect on your athletic performance -- and overall outlook, Corb says.</p>
							<h3>2. Use Visualization</h3>
							<p>Visualization is a common technique for handling stress. When you're overwhelmed, imagining yourself in a calm, soothing place for a few minutes can help you manage the stress. Athletes use it in other ways. "Some athletes use visualization right before a game to practice mentally," says David Geier, MD, an orthopaedic surgeon and director of Sports Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina. A basketball player might close his eyes and think about what a free throw will look like. A sprinter might imagine the gun going off and the first few steps. Visualization can give you a mental space to rehearse. Corb suggests another type of visualization. "I tell people to visualize past achievements," he says. "It's almost like a highlight reel that you play back in your mind. Focus on times you felt really good, and remember that feeling." It can give you a real boost, he says.</p>
							<h3>3. Plan for Setbacks</h3>
							<p>If you're a marathon runner, there are times when you'll hit the wall. If you're a golfer, you'll make a bad shot sometimes. These things happen. What really matters is what you do afterwards. "One of the things that separates elite athletes is their ability to hold up after a setback," says Corb. "They don't spiral out of control." Again, this isn't just about your personality -- it's a skill you can learn. How can you regain your focus when things go wrong? "You need to practice techniques to re-center yourself," Corb says. There's no one way to do it. Some athletes have a ritualized physical routine -- like a specific sequence of stretches. Others have a specific phrase that they repeat to themselves. Some play a specific song -- in their heads if they can't turn on their iPod. Others will take 30 seconds to do deep breathing. The point is to know what to do when the pressure mounts. Having a plan in place -- even if it's as simple as a word you repeat to yourself -- will boost your confidence.</p>
							<h3>4. Manage Stress</h3>
							<p>Feeling stressed before a competition? Try techniques like meditation or progressive muscle relaxation -- in which you consciously relax each muscle group, from your toes to your head. Of course, channeled the right way, stress can be your ally right before an athletic performance. "Not all stress is bad," says Geier. "The fight or flight response can push you harder during an athletic competition." Corb points out that positive stress (excitement) and negative stress (anxiety) really have the same physical effects. Your heart rate and breathing go up. Your pupils dilate. The difference is how you experience these effects. If excitement before a competition gets you amped up, that's good. If it's tipping you into panic, that's bad. Remember that when you feel stress building, you have some control over how to interpret it.</p>
							<h3>5. Sleep More</h3>
							<p>Not only does sleep help athletes physically -- allowing your body time to repair itself after a workout -- but it also has mental benefits. Studies have shown that getting enough sleep can improve reaction time and split second decision making. How much sleep do you need? Aim for at least seven to nine hours -- and more if you're under a lot of stress or doing intense workouts.</p>
							<h3>Develop a Plan to Build Your Mental Stamina</h3>
							<p>Of course, these tips are easier to read than to put into practice. No one gains mental stamina overnight -- it's a skill you have to learn. "When you watch Olympic athletes getting ready to perform, every single thing they do is intentional," says Corb. "They're focusing their minds with techniques they've learned and practiced for years. It takes a lot of hard work." Start working now to improve your mental stamina. You may not have the time to practice eight hours a day like an Olympian. But building your mental stamina has a lot of benefits for your game, your career, and life in general -- and it doesn't even require a gym membership.</p>

						<h2>THESE ARE THE BEST FAT-BURNING FOODS</h2>
						<div>
							<p>It’s true: Certain foods have a very high thermogenic effect, so you literally scorch calories as you chew. Other eats contain nutrients and compounds that stoke your metabolic fire. Feed your metabolism with these.</p>
							<h3>Whole Grains</h3>
							<p>Your body burns twice as many calories breaking down whole foods (especially those rich in fiber such as oatmeal and brown rice) than processed foods.</p>
							<h3>Lean Meats</h3>
							<p>Protein has a high thermogenic effect: You burn about 30% of the calories the food contains during digestion (so a 300-calorie chicken breast requires about 90 calories to break it down).</p>
							<h3>Low-Fat Dairy Products</h3>
							<p>Rich in calcium and vitamin D, these help preserve and build muscle mass—essential for maintaining a robust metabolism.</p>
							<h3>Green Tea</h3>
							<p>Drinking four cups of green tea a day helped people shed more than six pounds in eight weeks, the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reports. Credit EGCG, a compound in the brew that temporarily speeds metabolism after sipping it. To up your intake, keep a jug of iced tea in the fridge.</p>
							<h3>Lentils</h3>
							<p>One cup packs 35% of your daily iron needs—good news, since up to 20% of us are iron- deficient. When you lack a nutrient, your metab slows because the body’s not getting what it needs to work efficiently, says Tammy Lakatos Shames, RD, co-author of The Secret to Skinny.</p>
							<h3>Hot Peppers</h3>
							<p>Capsaicin, the compound that gives chili peppers their kick, heats up your body, which makes you melt additional calories. You can get it by eating raw, cooked, dried, or powdered peppers, says Lakatos Shames. “Add as much cayenne or hot sauce as possible to soups, eggs, and meats.”</p>

						<h2>HIDDEN BENEFITS OF EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY</h2>
						<div>
							<p>It might not be obvious on the scales, but healthy eating and increased physical activity from walking during pregnancy is directly associated with a range of improved outcomes at birth, according to researchers from the University of Adelaide.</p>
							<p>Results of the world's biggest study of its kind -- offering healthy eating and exercise advice to pregnant women who are overweight or obese -- are published today in two papers in the journal BMC Medicine.</p>
							<p>"While it might have been expected that healthier eating and increased physical activity during pregnancy would be associated with differences in weight gain, our findings highlight that weight gain in pregnancy is not an ideal measure of pregnancy health," says study leader Professor Jodie Dodd, from the University of Adelaide's Robinson Research Institute and the Women's and Children's Hospital. "Importantly, however, these changes in diet and physical activity were directly associated with significant improvements in outcomes for babies. </p>
							<p>"Women who received dietary and lifestyle advice increased the number of servings they consumed per day of fruits and vegetables, while reducing the percentage of energy in their diet derived from saturated fats. "Women were also successful in increasing their physical activity, with about 15-20 minutes of brisk walking on most days of the week," Professor Dodd says.</p>
							<p>Study leaders have previously reported a significant reduction in the number of babies born over 4kg to women who received the diet and lifestyle advice during pregnancy. The researchers can now report a range of other benefits for these babies, including a reduced chance of moderate to severe respiratory distress syndrome and reduced length of stay in hospital.</p>
							<p>"Approximately 50% of women are overweight or obese during pregnancy. Until this study was conducted, there had been little evidence about the overall benefits of dietary and lifestyle interventions on this group of women," says study co-author Dr Rosalie Grivell from the University's Robinson Research Institute.</p>
							<p>"Our hope is that by following some simple, practical and achievable lifestyle advice, pregnant women can improve their health and the outcomes for their babies. We would, of course, recommend that these lifestyle changes be adopted as much as possible before women become pregnant," Dr Grivell says.</p>

						<h2>FIND OUT WHY JOGGING KEEPS YOU YOUNG</h2>
						<div>
							<p>A new study by researchers at Humboldt State University and the University of Colorado, Boulder is shedding light on an unexpected benefit of jogging in older adults.</p>
							<p>The study looked at adults over the age of 65 -- some of whom walk for exercise and some who run for exercise. The researchers found that those who run at least 30 minutes, three times a week were less likely to experience age-related physical decline in walking efficiency than those who simply walked. In fact, the older runners were 7-10 percent more efficient at walking than those who didn't jog.</p>
							<p>"What we found is that older adults who regularly participate in high aerobic activities -- running in particular -- have what we call a lower metabolic cost of walking than older, sedentary adults. In fact, their metabolic cost of walking is similar to young adults in their 20s," said Justus Ortega, a Kinesiology Professor at Humboldt State and director of HSU's Biomechanics Lab.</p>
							<p>Metabolic cost is the amount of energy needed to move and naturally increases as we age. High metabolic cost contributes to making walking more difficult and tiring. Decline in walking ability is a key predictor of morbidity in older adults. In the study, researchers looked at self-reported older joggers over the age of 65 -- those who ran at least 30 minutes a day, three times a week -- and self-reported walkers, those who walked three times a week for 30 minutes. Participants were asked to walk on a treadmill at three speeds (1.6, 2.8 and 3.9 miles per hour) as researchers measured their oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production.</p>
							<p>Overall, older joggers were 7-10 percent more efficient at walking than older adults who just walked for exercise. Their metabolic cost was similar to young people in their 20s. Researchers aren't yet sure what makes joggers more efficient than walkers but they believe it may have something to do with the mitochondria found in cells. Evidence suggests that people who exercise vigorously have healthier mitochondria in their muscles.</p>
							<p>"The bottom line is that running keeps you younger, at least in terms of efficiency," said Rodger Kram, a Professor of Integrative Physiology at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and a co-author of the paper. Future studies are planned to examine whether other highly-aerobic activities -- such as swimming and cycling -- also mitigate age-related physical decline.</p>

						<h2>7 REASONS WHY COFFEE IS GOOD FOR YOU</h2>
						<div>
							<p>Coffee isn't just warm and energizing, it may also be extremely good for you.In recent years and decades, scientists have studied the effects of coffee on various aspects of health and their results have been nothing short of amazing.Here are 7 reasons why coffee may actually be one of the healthiest beverages on the planet.</p>
							<h3>1. Coffee Can Make You Smarter</h3>
							<p>Coffee doesn't just keep you awake, it may literally make you smarter as well. The active ingredient in coffee is caffeine, which is a stimulant and the most commonly consumed psychoactive substance in the world. Caffeine's primary mechanism in the brain is blocking the effects of an inhibitory neurotransmitter called Adenosine. By blocking the inhibitory effects of Adenosine, caffeine actually increases neuronal firing in the brain and the release of other neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine. Many controlled trials have examined the effects of caffeine on the brain, demonstrating that caffeine can improve mood, reaction time, memory, vigilance and general cognitive function.</p>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Bottom Line:</span> Caffeine potently blocks an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, leading to a net stimulant effect. Controlled trials show that caffeine improves both mood and brain function.</p>
							
							<h3>2. Coffee Can Help You Burn Fat and Improves Physical Performance</h3>
							<p>There's a good reason why you will find caffeine in most commercial fat burning supplements. Caffeine, partly due to its stimulant effect on the central nervous system, both raises metabolism and increases the oxidation of fatty acids. Caffeine can also improve athletic performance by several mechanisms, including by mobilizing fatty acids from the fat tissues. In two separate meta-analyses, caffeine was found to increase exercise performance by 11-12% on average.</p>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Bottom Line:</span> Caffeine raises the metabolic rate and helps to mobilize fatty acids from the fat tissues. It can also enhance physical performance.</p>
							
							<h3>3. Coffee May Drastically Lower Your Risk of Type II Diabetes</h3>
							<p>Type II diabetes is a lifestyle-related disease that has reached epidemic proportions, having increased 10-fold in a few decades and now afflicting about 300 million people. This disease is characterized by high blood glucose levels due to insulin resistance or an inability to produce insulin. In observational studies, coffee has been repeatedly associated with a lower risk of diabetes. The reduction in risk ranges from 23% all the way up to 67%. A massive review article looked at 18 studies with a total of 457.922 participants. Each additional cup of coffee per day lowered the risk of diabetes by 7%. The more coffee people drank, the lower their risk.</p>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Bottom Line:</span> Drinking coffee is associated with a drastically reduced risk of type II diabetes. People who drink several cups per day are the least likely to become diabetic.</p>
							
							<h3>4. Coffee May Lower Your Risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's</h3>
							<p>Not only can coffee make you smarter in the short term, it may also protect your brain in old age. Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the world and a leading cause of dementia. In prospective studies, coffee drinkers have up to a 60% lower risk of Alzheimer's and dementia. Parkinson's is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by death of dopamine-generating neurons in the brain. Coffee may lower the risk of Parkinson's by 32-60%.</p>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Bottom Line:</span> Coffee is associated with a much lower risk of dementia and the neurodegenerative disorders Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.</p>
							
							<h3>5. Coffee May be Extremely Good For Your Liver</h3>
							<p>The liver is a remarkable organ that carries out hundreds of vital functions in the body. It is very vulnerable to modern insults such as excess consumption of alcohol and fructose. Cirrhosis is the end stage of liver damage caused by diseases like alcoholism and hepatitis, where liver tissue has been largely replaced by scar tissue. Multiple studies have shown that coffee can lower the risk of cirrhosis by as much as 80%, the strongest effect for those who drank 4 or more cups per day. Coffee may also lower the risk of liver cancer by around 40%.</p>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Bottom Line:</span> Coffee appears to be protective against certain liver disorders, lowering the risk of liver cancer by 40% and cirrhosis by as much as 80%.</p>
							
							<h3>6. Coffee May Decrease Your Risk of Dying</h3>
							<p>Many people still seem to think that coffee is unhealthy. This isn't surprising though, since it is very common for conventional wisdom to be at exact odds with what the actual studies say. In two very large prospective epidemiological studies, drinking coffee was associated with a lower risk of death by all causes. This effect is particularly profound in type II diabetics, one study showing that coffee drinkers had a 30% lower risk of death during a 20 year period.</p>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Bottom Line:</span> Coffee consumption has been associated with a lower risk of death in prospective epidemiological studies, especially in type II diabetics.</p>
							
							<h3>7. Coffee is Loaded With Nutrients and Antioxidants</h3>
							<p>Coffee isn't just black water. Many of the nutrients in the coffee beans do make it into the final drink, which actually contains a decent amount of vitamins and minerals. 6% of the RDA for Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5). 11% of the RDA for Riboflavin (Vitamin B2). 2% of the RDA for Niacin (B3) and Thiamine (B1). 3% of the RDA for Potassium and Manganese. May not seem like much, but if you drink several cups of coffee per day then this quickly adds up. But this isn't all. Coffee also contains a massive amount of antioxidants. In fact, coffee is the biggest source of antioxidants in the western diet, outranking both fruits and vegetables combined.</p>
							<p><span class="news_bold">Bottom Line:</span> Coffee contains a decent amount of several vitamins and minerals. It is also the biggest source of antioxidants in the modern diet.</p>
							
							<h3>Take Home Message</h3>
							<p>Even though coffee in moderate amounts is good for you, drinking way too much of it can still be harmful. I'd also like to point out that many of the studies above were epidemiological in nature. Such studies can only show association, they can not prove that coffee caused the effects. To make sure to preserve the health benefits, don't put sugar or anything nasty in your coffee! If it tends to affect your sleep, then don't drink it after 2pm. At the end of the day, it does seem quite clear that coffee is NOT the villain it was made out to be. If anything, coffee may literally be the healthiest beverage on the planet.</p>
