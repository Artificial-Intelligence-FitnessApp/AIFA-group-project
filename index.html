					<h5 id="chest" class="exercise-title">Chest Exercise<span class="arrow-down">&#9660;</span><span class="arrow-up">&#9650;</h5>
					<nav id="show-chest">
						<ol class="exercise">
							<li>Flat Barbell or Dumbbell Bench Press<span class="chest"><img src="images/chest1.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a dumbbell bench press"><p>    Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other.
								Then, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width.
								Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position.
								Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.
								Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.

								Caution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Incline Barbell or Dumbbell Bench Press<span class="chest"><img src="images/chest2.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a incline dumbbell bench press"><p>
								Lie back on an incline bench. Using a medium-width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
								As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on you upper chest.
								After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: it should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
								Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
								When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.

								Caution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used. Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall on your upper chest and nowhere else.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Decline Barbell<span class="chest"><img src="images/chest3.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a decline barbell"><p>
								Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and slowly lay down on the bench.
								Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Tip: In order to protect your rotator cuff, it is best if you have a spotter help you lift the barbell off the rack.
								As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your lower chest.
								After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up).
								Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
								When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.
								Caution:
								If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.
								Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to touch your lower chest and nowhere else.
								Don't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>Flat Chest Press Machine<span class="chest"><img src="images/chest4.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a press machine"><p>
								Place a flat bench underneath the smith machine. Now place the barbell at a height that you can reach when lying down and your arms are almost fully extended. Once the weight you need is selected, lie down on the flat bench. Using a pronated grip that is wider than shoulder width, unlock the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
								As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest.
								After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
								Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
								When you are done, lock the bar back in the rack.
								Caution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Dips (on parallel bars with slight forward lean)<span class="chest"><img src="images/chest5.jpg" alt="a guy exercise dips on paralles bars"><p>
								For this exercise you will need access to parallel bars. To get yourself into the starting position, hold your body at arms length (arms locked) above the bars.
								While breathing in, lower yourself slowly with your torso leaning forward around 30 degrees or so and your elbows flared out slightly until you feel a slight stretch in the chest.
								Once you feel the stretch, use your chest to bring your body back to the starting position as you breathe out. Tip: Remember to squeeze the chest at the top of the movement for a second.
								Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
								Variations:
								If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a dip assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Push-Ups<span class="chest"><img src="images/chest6.jpg" alt="a guy doing pushups"><p>
								Lie on the floor face down and place your hands about 36 inches apart while holding your torso up at arms length.
								Next, lower yourself downward until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale.
								Now breathe out and press your upper body back up to the starting position while squeezing your chest.
								After a brief pause at the top contracted position, you can begin to lower yourself downward again for as many repetitions as needed.
								Variations:
								If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, you can either bend your legs at the knees to take off resistance or perform the exercise against the wall instead of the floor.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Flat Dumbbell Flyes<span class="chest"><img src="images/chest7.jpg" alt="a guy doing flat dumbbell flyes"><p>
								Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell on each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other.
								Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width with the palms of your hands facing each other. Raise the dumbbells up like you're pressing them, but stop and hold just before you lock out. This will be your starting position.
								With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.
								Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.
								Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>Incline Dumbbell Flyes<span class="chest"><img src="images/chest8.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a incline dumbbell flyes"><p>
								Hold a dumbbell on each hand and lie on an incline bench that is set to an incline angle of no more than 30 degrees.
								Extend your arms above you with a slight bend at the elbows.
								Now rotate the wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing you. Tip: The pinky fingers should be next to each other. This will be your starting position.
								As you breathe in, start to slowly lower the arms to the side while keeping the arms extended and while rotating the wrists until the palms of the hand are facing each other. Tip: At the end of the movement the arms will be by your side with the palms facing the ceiling.
								As you exhale start to bring the dumbbells back up to the starting position by reversing the motion and rotating the hands so that the pinky fingers are next to each other again. Tip: Keep in mind that the movement will only happen at the shoulder joint and at the wrist. There is no motion that happens at the elbow joint.
								Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Decline Dumbbell Flyes<span class="chest"><img src="images/chest9.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a decline dumbbell flyest"><p> Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down with a dumbbell on each hand on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other.
								Once you are laying down, move the dumbbells in front of you at shoulder width. The palms of the hands should be facing each other and the arms should be perpendicular to the floor and fully extended. This will be your starting position.
								With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.
								Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.
								Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions</p>
							</li>
							<li>Pec Deck Machine<span class="chest"><img src="images/chest10.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a peck deck machine"><p>
								Sit on the machine with your back flat on the pad.
								Take hold of the handles. Tip: Your upper arms should be positioned parallel to the floor; adjust the machine accordingly. This will be your starting position.
								Push the handles together slowly as you squeeze your chest in the middle. Breathe out during this part of the motion and hold the contraction for a second.
								Return back to the starting position slowly as you inhale until your chest muscles are fully stretched.
								Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Cable Crossovers/Cable Flyes<span class="chest"><img src="images/chest11.jpg" alt="a guy exercise with cable crossover"><p>
								To get yourself into the starting position, place the pulleys on a high position (above your head), select the resistance to be used and hold the pulleys in each hand.
								Step forward in front of an imaginary straight line between both pulleys while pulling your arms together in front of you. Your torso should have a small forward bend from the waist. This will be your starting position.
								With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, extend your arms to the side (straight out at both sides) in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms and torso should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.
								Return your arms back to the starting position as you breathe out. Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.
								Hold for a second at the starting position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

						<ol class="exercise">
							<li>Dumbbell Overhead Bulgarian Split Squat
							<span class="leg"><img src="images/leg1.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a dumbbell Overhead squat"><p>START: Grasp a light dumbbell in one hand, stand erect and place the top or toes of the same-side foot on a box or bench behind you, knee bent. Press the weight overhead so your arm is directly over your shoulder.
								EXECUTION: Keeping your arm extended, bend your front knee and hips to descend straight toward the floor. When your front quad comes parallel to the floor, press back up through your front heel to return to the start. Repeat for reps, then switch sides.
								GUNNAR’S TIP: “Stand tall throughout the movement. There’s a tendency to tip forward as you descend, but you need to work on staying tall.”</p></span></li>
							<li>Kettlebell Swing With Flip to Squat
							<span class="leg"><img src="images/leg2.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a dumbbell Overhead squat"><p>START: Grasp the handle of a kettlebell with both hands and stand erect with your arms hanging straight toward the floor, feet roughly shoulder-width apart.
								EXECUTION: Bend your knees to dip down while lowering the weight between your legs. Keeping your arms extended, explosively swing the kettlebell up by extending your knees and hips, and lifting your arms. As the weight passes shoulder level, quickly bend your elbows and knees to drop underneath it (letting it flip over in your hands) and catch it in front of you in a full squat position. Stand up while pressing the kettlebell overhead, then drop back down to the start.
								GUNNAR’S TIP: “Stay focused on every part of the movement: exploding, the catch, lowering and driving up. You can’t phone this one in.”</p></li>
							<li>One-Leg Extension With Angled Crunch (+ burnout)<span class="leg"><img src="images/leg3.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a dumbbell Overhead squat"><p>START: Sit in a leg extension machine and adjust the roller so it rests across the front of your ankles.
								EXECUTION: Perform a one-leg extension with your right leg while simultaneously crunching and twisting your torso to bring your left pec over your right knee. Reverse the motion, then repeat to the opposite side — extension with your left leg while crunching your right pec over your left knee. That’s one rep. After you complete all reps, finish the set with double-leg extensions to failure.
								GUNNAR’S TIP: “Don’t bounce the weight. On the extension, really think about reaching that toe out and making that leg as long as possible. Don’t just snap it up.”</p></li>
							<li>Smith Machine Front Squat to Back Squat<span class="leg"><img src="images/leg4.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a dumbbell Overhead squat"><p>START: Stand erect in a Smith machine with your feet shoulder-width apart, head up and the bar resting across your front delts, hands grasping the bar.
								EXECUTION: Descend into a squat, keeping your back flat and chest out, until your quads are parallel to the floor. Drive back up to standing and repeat for reps. Then rerack the bar, position yourself for back squats and complete the prescribed number of reps.
								GUNNAR’S TIP: “Try to focus on driving through your heels on the back squat so you get the most out of your hams and glutes.”</P></li>
							<li>Lying Leg Curl to Hyper extension<span class="leg"><img src="images/leg5.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a dumbbell Overhead squat"><p>START: If it’s available, choose a leg-curl machine with an angled (not flat) bench. Lie facedown, position the backs of your ankles against the pad with your legs extended and make sure your knees are off the edge of the bench.
								EXECUTION: Contract your hamstrings to bend your knees and pull your heels toward your glutes. At the top of the rep, contract your lower back muscles to perform a hyperextension (the range of motion will be very small). Lower your torso to the pad, then return to the start.
								GUNNAR’S TIP: “Rise slowly on the hyperextension and go for the contraction. This is one you really want to feel; you don’t want to just knock them out.”</P></li>
							<li>Zercher Squat <span class="leg"><img src="images/leg6.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a dumbbell Overhead squat"><p>    Set up the bar on a rack.
								Extend your forearms out in front of your body (bent at elbows) and place the bar on top of upper forearms.
								Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.
								Begin to lower the bar by bending the knees - maintain a straight posture with the head up.
								Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees.
								Come back up to the starting position.</P></li>
							<li>Donkey Calf Raise <span class="leg"><img src="images/leg7.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a dumbbell Overhead squat"><p>Set the lower back/hip pad at the correct height. Position the balls of your feet on the feet plate (see "Further Clarification for an explanation of how to target different aspects of the calf muscles) with your heels hanging off (beyond the feet plate) and your legs extended, lean your torso forward, and place your forearms on the arm pads.
								Press with your feet until your calves are fully flexed, keeping your legs straight at the knees, while exhaling throughout the positive aspect of the movement.
								Lower until your heels are lower than the feet plate (a deep stretch will be felt in the calves), and inhale throughout the (negative) aspect of the movement.</P></li>
							<li>Glute-Ham Raise <span class="leg"><img src="images/leg8.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a dumbbell Overhead squat"><p>
								You can use a partner for this exercise or brace your feet under something stable.
								Begin on your knees with your upper legs and torso upright. If using a partner, they will firmly hold your feet to keep you in position. This will be your starting position.
								Lower yourself by extending at the knee, taking care to NOT flex the hips as you go forward.
								Place your hands in front of you as you reach the floor. This movement is very difficult and you may be unable to do it unaided. Use your arms to lightly push off the floor to aid your return to the starting position.
								</P>

								Begin with a bar on a rack at shoulder height. Rack the bar across the rear of your shoulders as you would a power squat, not on top of your shoulders. Keep your back tight, shoulder blades pinched together, and your knees slightly bent. Step back from the rack.
								Begin by bending at the hips, moving them back as you bend over to near parallel. Keep your back arched and your cervical spine in proper alignment.
								Reverse the motion by extending through the hips with your glutes and hamstrings. Continue until you have returned to the starting position.
								</P>

							<li>Mountain Climbers<span class="leg"><img src="images/leg10.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a dumbbell Overhead squat"><p>
								Begin in a pushup position, with your weight supported by your hands and toes. Flexing the knee and hip, bring one leg until the knee is approximately under the hip. This will be your starting position.
								Explosively reverse the positions of your legs, extending the bent leg until the leg is straight and supported by the toe, and bringing the other foot up with the hip and knee flexed. Repeat in an alternating fashion for 20-30 seconds.</P>

							<li>Sumo Deadlift<span class="leg"><img src="images/leg12.jpg" alt="a guy exercise a dumbbell Overhead squat"><p>
								Begin with a bar loaded on the ground. Approach the bar so that the bar intersects the middle of the feet. The feet should be set very wide, near the collars. Bend at the hips to grip the bar. The arms should be directly below the shoulders, inside the legs, and you can use a pronated grip, a mixed grip, or hook grip. Relax the shoulders, which in effect lengthens your arms.
								Take a breath, and then lower your hips, looking forward with your head with your chest up. Drive through the floor, spreading your feet apart, with your weight on the back half of your feet. Extend through the hips and knees.As the bar passes through the knees, lean back and drive the hips into the bar, pulling your shoulder blades together.Return the weight to the ground by bending at the hips and controlling the weight on the way down.</P>
