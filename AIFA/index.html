						<h2>Fitness Terminator </h2>
							<p>Mr. Olympia titles, Arnold Schwarzenegger was a promising young bodybuilder</p>
							<div class="expanded">
								<p>Long before he governed the Golden State and outmuscled bad guys on the silver screen, even before he won a then-record seven Mr. Olympia titles, Arnold Schwarzenegger was a promising young bodybuilder who had one glaring weakness (seriously) -- his legs. At 6'2", Arnold knew firsthand the difficulty tall bodybuilders face in bringing up their lower bodies. Rather than accepting this shortcoming, however, Arnold endured the most grueling, even sickening, workouts up to three times a week to build massive tree-trunk thighs worthy of someone nicknamed The Oak.
								While Arnold did conventional exercises, his training strategy was anything but. He approached leg days with an extraordinary tolerance for pain and dedication to push his body past its physical limits. While anyone can repeat the six exercises that make up his routine, few can duplicate his legs-into-Jell-O intensity. But we're guessing at least a few of you have the cojones to give it a try. That's why, for the first time ever, M&F is publishing the incredibly effective workout and training techniques that completely transformed Arnold'’s legs</p>

						<p>Workout without knowledge is not good for your health or your time.</p>
						<p>If you are like of the most of people, working out is not exactly the best time of your day. So when do you take the time to work out, you want to make sure you are getting the most out of every move. The better the moves feel and the faster you see results, the more likely that you will start to enjoy your workouts. So here are the workouts you want to avoid if you don’t want to waste your time.</p>

							<h3>1.	Crunches</h3>
								<p>These are exercises that pretty much no one enjoys anyway so it’s probably a good thing that they are not good for your workout. Crunches only work the front ab muscles and not the waist or the lower abs, therefore it could create a muscle imbalance which can lead to back problems. Settle for regular sits ups or even planks which work all the ab muscles.</p>

							<h3>2.	Supermans</h3>
								<p>Trust me you do not want to be doing Supermans if you are trying to look like Superman. This exercise involves laying on your stomach and then raising the arms and legs. It is a very small range of motion and it is often done incorrectly which leads to lower back problems. There is also no way to make the move harder or adjust for skill level so it basically becomes useless quickly even if done correctly.</p>

							<h3>3.	Lying Leg Curl</h3>
								<p>Not only do most people look ridiculous doing it, the Lying Leg Curl is really not an exercise anyone needs to be doing. It forces your muscles to work in a way that they do not normally move. Just about any other leg exercise will be more effective at working your leg muscles because they do so in a way that your legs are meant to and it works the muscles you actually use.</p>

							<h3>4.	Round Back Deadlifts</h3>
								<p>If you are just a casual exerciser or someone just looking to tone up you likely have not tried this exercise. If you have it’s either because you were misled about its effectiveness or you just saw someone else doing it and gave it a try. In reality it can very easily put too much strain on your shoulders and lead to severe injuries. If you really want to work your glutes (which what this exercise is for) then stick with squats or the leg press.</p>

								<h3>5.	Lat Pull Down Behind the Head</h3>
									<p>If you are looking at that machine with the hanging bar and think it’s a good idea to work your muscles by pulling the bar down behind your head…just don’t. While this may seem like a good exercise and the bulky guys at the gym look great doing it, most people do not have the shoulder flexibility to do this with proper form. That means you are likely to injure yourself doing an exercise that is nowhere near as efficient as a military press (which works the same muscles).</p>

							<h3>6.	Wrist Curls</h3>
								<p>The purpose of this exercise is really not clear, although it may be intended to strengthen a person’s grip. It is important to remember that your wrist is a joint that you want to protect and not a muscle you want to strengthen. Therefore go with an exercise like the Farmer’s Walk if you want to improve grip. That way you won’t stress the wrist and you’ll work more of your body.</p>

							<h3>7.	Smith Machine Squats</h3>
								<p>This machine is just a disaster waiting to happen. The bar you use does not move from its straight path so it can force your back into a position it is not used to. Most people will also put themselves into a bad squat position when using the machine so it’s typically not effective and it can lead to injury.</p>

							<h3>8.	Dumbell Loaded Side Bends</h3>
								<p>This exercise gets added to the growing pile of exercises that don’t do what you think they will and you’ll probably get hurt doing them anyway. Even done properly this exercise puts too much compression on the spine as the soft tissues within the spine. Therefore you are at significant risk of rupturing a disc as you do this exercise.</p>

							<h3>9.	Standing Chest Fly</h3>
								<p>This exercise is meant to work your chest and it does if you do it laying down. However when you do it standing up gravity is pulling down on your arms. Therefore instead of working your chest, you are really working your shoulders. Even worse is that you are putting stress on your rotator cuffs which could lead to injury especially as you increase weight.</p>

							<h3>10.	Vertical Leg Press</h3>
								<p>This leg press does work your legs but it also puts a lot of pressure on your spine. This is just a back injury waiting to happen especially if you start getting into really high weights. If you want to work your legs and have less chance of injury, stick with weighted squats.</p>

							<p>Many people dream of having a definite negative or abdomen. But the issue goes far beyond aesthetics: a six pack abdomen is also synonymous with health.

							<p>To get in shape for health, no matter if you have a waist advantaged or lack little to the dream abdomen negative, what matters is discipline, routine and effective exercises.</p>
							<p>Remember that doing 500 crunches a day to get a negative abdomen is myth. The truth is that we all have the muscles of the abdomen well formed, are only covered by a layer of fat and water.</p>

						<h2>Myth and truth about bodybuilding and Women </h2>
					<div class="expanded">
						<h3>Bodybuilding and Women</h3>
							<p>One of the main hormones responsible for increasing muscle mass is testosterone, present in both men and women. The difference is that in males, the body produces this substance in larger quantities.</p>
							<p>Thus, it is impossible for a woman to gain huge muscles by lifting light weight. Those who practice bodybuilding frequently and have a good diet, will have a toned and defined but not masculine body. In professional bodybuilders, other substances are used to achieve a strong body and many muscles.</p>
							<p>It is also worth remembering that muscle and fat tissues are different, so it is not possible to transform one into the other. What happens is the decrease in fat by increasing metabolism, a result of the gain in muscle mass combined with cardio training and a balanced diet.</p>
							<p>Some women believe that if they stop training their muscles will be transformed into fat. This is another myth. What happens is decreased due to lack of muscle stimulation and fat gain because of inactivity, and generally leaving the diet. Then:
							Sedentary lifestyle + bad food = fat gain</p>
							<p>Unfortunately it is normal to hear that women train to be able to eat whatever they want. Very careful with it! Not because you train you can eat everything and in great quantity.</p>
							<p>The math is simple: If you eat more calories than you can burn, just fatter. So it is interesting to seek a professional in the area of food and through a balanced diet, getting to the negative balance of calories to positive results.</p>
							<p>Try combining aerobic and strength training. You may even lose weight just by doing aerobic exercises, however besides losing fat, lose muscle mass as well. In addition to combining the two exercises, you have a sharp burning fat and is still with the firm muscles and minimizes injuries. If you want to train or trains, always look for a professional physical education.</p>
